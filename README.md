# ImageForgeryDetection

The program file is named Image Forgery Detection (ELA and CNN). It is a IPYNB file type where it can be run smoother on jupyter notebook.

1. Packages has to be ensured that installed with the IDE.
2. It might need some times for data pre-processing and epoch(machine learning).
3. This project is built up using python programming language.
4. The aim for this project is to built up an AI machine to predict whether an input image is forged or not.
5. The algorithm using for the machine learning is Convolutional Neural Netwrok(CNN).
6. since it requires a data sets that contain images in order to train the modelm thus, i have trained and saved the model inside the folder names "model.cnn".
7. The sizes of the data set is very large so that i am not able to upload over here. However, i am willing to share it if you are interested.
